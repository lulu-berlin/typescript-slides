# [JavaScript that scales](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## A superset of JavaScript

- all valid JS code is valid TS code

- not a different language

- compiles into JS

- compiling = removing type information = JS

---

## Scaling

- large codebase

- large team

- can't rely on spoken explanations
